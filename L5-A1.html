                <h2>Facts About Dogs</h2>
                <p>
                    The dog (Canis familiaris or Canis lupus familiaris) is a domesticated descendant of the gray wolf.
                    The dog was the first species to be domesticated by humans, over 14,000 years ago and before the development of agriculture. 
                    Due to their long association with humans, dogs have gained the ability to thrive on a starch-rich diet that would be inadequate for other canids.
                    Dogs have been bred for desired behaviors, sensory capabilities, and physical attributes. Dog breeds vary widely in shape, size, and color. 
                    They have the same number of bones (with the exception of the tail), powerful jaws that house around 42 teeth, and well-developed senses of smell, hearing, 
                    and sight.
                    Compared to humans, dogs possess a superior sense of smell and hearing, but inferior visual acuity. Dogs perform many roles for humans, such as hunting, herding,
                    pulling loads, protection, companionship, therapy, aiding disabled people, and assisting police and the military.

                    The global dog population is estimated at 700 million to 1 billion, distributed around the world. 
                    The dog is the most popular pet in the United States, present in 34–40% of households.
                    Developed countries make up approximately 20% of the global dog population,
                    while around 75% of dogs are estimated to be from developing countries, mainly in the form of feral and community dogs.
